                            <p>We are over joyed to invite a new addition to our family, the lion cub Simba. Simba was born on the 4th October at 8am and it took the zoo vets an hour to deliver cub. We was very proud of our mama lion for being patient for so long. We are currently keeping the cub in a private area just until Simba is healthy enough to join his family in the pen</p>
